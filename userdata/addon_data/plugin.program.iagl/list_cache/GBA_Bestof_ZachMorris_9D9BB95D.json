This feature was introduced in FF3 (which also languished in Japan until 2006), but FF5 evolved it and made it truly notable.

An X-parasite infection early on in the story forces doctors to fuse her DNA with the baby Metroid\u2019s.

Not only are the COs endearing and memorable as characters, but each wields special powers to suit your personal playstyle.
