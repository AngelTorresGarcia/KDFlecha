Once Tengen got involved with RBI Baseball, the game had changed forever; RBI was what we were looking for all along.[CR]RBI Baseball was the first ever sports game licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, and as such all of the players on the diamond were authentic MLB athletes (though the MLB itself did not lend a license, so the teams were differentiated by their cities and colors, no team names or logos allowed). The gameplay felt more like a real baseball game; the pitching was way more authentic, and the players\u2019 stats actually represented their real abilities.
