Super Mario 3 took everything you loved about 2D side-scrollers and expanded on it with new abilities, stages, and genre conventions that developers still use today.[CR]Not only was the ability to fly revolutionary from a gameplay and level-design perspective, SMB3 has a laundry list of little touches and secrets that make it unforgettable. Few can forget the first time they saw Dry Bones reassemble itself, or when an angry sun left the background and chased you with deadly intent. With power-ups, enemies, music, and graphics that are just as memorable now as then, no other game is more deserving of being named the best NES game of all time.", "tag": ["USA", "Rev A"], "trailer": "plugin://plugin.video.youtube/play/?video_id=H1Ui3ZDX9MI", "size": 226305, "lastplayed": "2024-04-24 22:28:59"}, "art": {"poster": "https://i.imgur.com/rtrFQeP.jpg", "banner": "https://i.imgur.com/i0C3guX.png", "fanart": "https://i.imgur.com/Wk931LY.jpg", "landscape": "https://i.imgur.com/r1MDfME.jpg", "clearlogo": "https://i.imgur.com/9ivlmuX.png", "icon": "https://i.imgur.com/9ivlmuX.png", "thumb": "https://i.imgur.com/rtrFQeP.jpg"}, "properties": {"route": "NES_Bestof_ZachMorris", "nplayers": "1-2 Alt", "perspective": "Platform", "description": "1.

Whether you started playing game before, during, or after the era of the little gray box that could, Nintendo's first Entertainment System provided joy, laughs, frustration, and straight up anger for millions of kids and adults alike.

There are names here that still live on today and others that have fallen by the wayside, but all of them are incredible experiences from a time when games were more about fun and challenge than big budgets and flashy graphics.
